# Azure Blob Storage Example with .NET 9 API and Angular 19

## About the Repository
This repository showcases a comprehensive example of Azure Blob Storage integration using a modern tech stack:

- **Backend**: A .NET 9 API project.
- **Frontend**: An Angular 19 project with Material Design for a sleek and user-friendly interface.

It provides robust examples for handling Azure Blob Storage, including three types of upload APIs:

1. **File Upload**: Upload files directly to Azure Blob Storage.
2. **Chunk Upload**: Handle large files by uploading them in smaller chunks.
3. **Stream Upload**: Stream data directly to Azure Blob Storage for efficient handling of larger datasets.

This repository is an excellent starting point for developers looking to integrate Azure Blob Storage in their projects with modern web technologies.
